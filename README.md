# FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design<br>
## Project 1: Build a Tribute Page.
I chose to build Alan Turing's tribute page with HTML and CSS. In the future I plan to add a button to switch between light and dark mode.<br><br>
# Project 2: Build a Survey Form<br>
I built the site in HTML and CSS, it has various features that allow for correct form submission! I plan to make the background easier to see and make the background image scale better on a desktop, as of the time of writing this, the mobile device's rendering of the page looks good to me.
