			Below are just a handful of his accomplishments:
		</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Invented the Turing Machine<br></strong>
			In 1936, Turing theorized in a paper titled <i>On Computable Numbers</i> that one day, a machine could solve any problem that a human could simply using 0's, 1's, and memory. This idea laid the groundwork for the computers we have today.<br>

   </ul>

		<li>
			<strong>Turing played a major role in winning World War II<br></strong>
			In 1939, Turing began working with the British government and created a codebreaking machine called the Bombe. This device shortened the number of steps required for British codebreakers to decipher German encrypted messages (up to 4000 messages a day).
		</li>
	</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Cracked the Enigma machine<br></strong>
			The Enigma was a mechanical device used by German forces to encode secure messages. It was nearly impossible to decrypt without the correct cipher, which the Germans changed every day. In 1941, cryptologists and Turing decoded the German Enigma machines and saved thousands of allied force's lives. In 1942, he travelled to America to help with their own codebreaking work.
